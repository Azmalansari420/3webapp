          <h4 class="text-start"> <strong> How we use cookies </strong></h4>

          <p class="text-start">A cookie is a small file that asks permission to be placed on your computer’s hard drive. Once you agree,
            the file is
            added, and the cookie helps analyse web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular site. Cookies
            allow web
            applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your
            needs, likes, and
            dislikes by gathering and remembering your preferences. We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages
            are being
            used. This helps us analyse data about webpage traffic and improve our website to tailor it to customer
            needs. We only
            use this information for statistical analysis, which removes the data from the system. Overall, cookies help
            us provide
            a better website by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no
            way gives us
            access to your computer or any information about you other than the data you choose to share with us. You
            can choose to
            accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can modify your browser
            settings to
            decline cookies. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.</p>
